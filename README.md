This project is part of other projects I'm working on to study new things, like Typescript an Node.js. The goal is to achieve [this design](https://www.figma.com/file/s1hRy78EXUJEpr5fLR2s85/Helladarion-Codex?node-id=0%3A1) I created on Figma. It will get the data from another project, [Helladarion API](https://github.com/bolognini/helladarion), through a GET method and according with a query string on URL. Then, with the information collected, the application will have editable components to update informations and send them back to the API as well. With that we can build our T20 RPG System sheet that persists information and we can use it on a RPG campaign ðŸŽ².
